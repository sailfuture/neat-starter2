<strong>We Don’t Just Teach the WHAT; We Teach the WHY</strong><br></br>
Dynamic lesson plans help students learn by synthesizing lesson content, critical thinking, and problem solving in order to demonstrate formative mastery throughout each term. An anchor theme serves as a guide for interdisciplinary integration and informs the objectives and outcomes of a term across subjects.  Students learn through the why: why we do it, why we should know it, why it matters. <br></br>
<strong>We Teach Business by Doing Business</strong><br></br>
Students participate in two 6-hour Learning Labs per week where they are exposed to real-world business challenges in the maritime, construction and culinary fields. Learning labs prepare students to enter their 11th grade year, where they learn business by doing business as paid apprentices in one of our social enterprises. In 12th grade, students take these skills into an external work-study placement with a company in SailFuture’s business council.          </p>
          
<div class="text-lg text-gray-500">
<strong>We Believe That Personalized Feedback = Student Growth</strong><br></br>
All students receive daily professionalism scores and weekly narrative evaluations on formative assessments from each instructor that provide insight to a student’s strengths and weaknesses. At the conclusion of a term, students receive an updated skills profile detailing continued and/or new areas of strength, which is determined by the entire grade-level team.<br></br>  
<strong>We Cannot Educate Without Trust and Respect</strong><br></br>
We believe in the power of meaningful relationships built on trust and respect.  Each student is matched in a crew of 8 with its own name, identity, and crew leader.  The crew plays an integral role in helping each student feel seen, safe and secure in their learning space facilitating a greater willingness to take risks and explore their interests without judgment. </div>
