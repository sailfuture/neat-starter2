            <p>SailFuture Academy is a private high school with an entrepreneurship focus that prepares students to think critically and effectively solve real-world problems by integrating fundamental business concepts into the Humanities and STEM curriculums in all grades. 
<br></br>
Through dynamic lesson planning, students learn by immediately synthesizing lesson content, critical thinking, and problem solving in order to demonstrate formative mastery throughout each term. An anchor theme serves as a guide for interdisciplinary integration, which in turn informs the objectives and outcomes of a term across subjects.  Thus helping students see value in pragmatic learning that relates to the challenges they face in life by learning through the why: why we do it, why we should know it, why it matters. 
<br></br>
Outside of the classroom, students participate in two 6-hour Learning Labs per week where they are exposed to real-world business challenges in the maritime, construction and culinary fields. In the 11th and 12th grade years, students intern and apprentice in three student-led social enterprises - the SailFuture Kitchen, the SailFuture Construction Team, and the SailFuture Boat Donation program, with the option to specialize. In these years, students learn business by doing business while acquiring technical skills and building a resume that helps them prepare for career launch or college placement upon high school graduation.

            <p>All students will receive daily professionalism scores and weekly narrative evaluations on formative assessments from each instructor that provide meaningful feedback on each studentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses.
              <br></br>
              At the conclusion of a term, students receive an updated skills profile detailing continued and/or new areas of strength, which is determined by the entire grade-level team. This system focuses on the relationship between faculty members and students and makes the learning process more personal for both the instructor and the student while at the same time upholding and reinforcing the objectives of each term. 
<br></br>
Finally, we believe not only in the power of students but also in the power of meaningful relationships built on trust and respect.  Each student is matched in a crew of 8 with its own name, identity, and crew leader.  The crew plays an integral role in helping each student feel seen, safe and secure in their learning space.  By traversing through the classes together as well as one hour of dedicated meeting time each day, crews help facilitate a greater willingness to take risks and explore their interests without judgment due to emphasis on building trust and discussions around important life lessons and character development.
