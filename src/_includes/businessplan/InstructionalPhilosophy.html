      SailFuture Academy is a private high school that prepares students to think critically and effectively solve problems in order to become business owners and operators. 
            <br></br>
      Our instructional philosophy is rooted in the idea that learning by doing is the best way to engage and motivate learners who are disengaged in traditional school settings and modalities. 
            <br></br>
      We believe that disengaged students are not at fault for poor academic performance. It is incumbent upon the school to design an educational model that shows students the value and purpose of the lessons and opportunities therein.
            <br></br>
      Through dynamic lesson planning that is informed by the developmental needs of an adolescent, students learn by immediately synthesizing lesson content, critical thinking , and problem solving in order to demonstrate formative mastery throughout each term.

      <p class="mt-8 text-gray-500">
      Each term has an anchor theme that guides the objectives and outcomes of a term across subjects.  Therefore,  the interconnectivity of the subjects is explicitly detailed thus helping out students see value in practical learning that relates to the immediate challenges they face in everyday life by learning through the why: why we do it, why we should know it, why it matters. 
      <br></br>
      The SailFuture Academyâ€™s academic design centers around the theme of entrepreneurship, integrating fundamental business concepts into the Humanities and STEM curriculums in all grades. Outside of the classroom, students participate in two 6-hour Learning Labs per week where they are exposed to real-world business problem solving challenges in the maritime, construction and culinary fields. 
      <br></br>
      In the 11th and 12th grade years, students intern and apprentice in three student-led social enterprises - the SailFuture Kitchen, the SailFuture Construction Team, and the SailFuture Boat Donation program, with the option to specialize. In these years, students learn business by doing business while acquiring technical skills and building a resume that helps them prepare for career launch upon high school graduation.

      We believe not only in the power of students but also in the power of meaningful relationships built on trust and respect.  All of our students are grouped into crews of 8. Each crew will have its own name, identity, and crew leader.  The crew system is an important part of helping each student feel seen, safe and secure in their learning space thereby facilitating a greater willingness to take risks and explore their interests without judgment. 
      <br></br>
      Crews have one hour of dedicated meeting time each day during which crews discuss and work through important life lessons and social emotional skills in a more insulated environment. Additionally, crews traverse through the school day together and compete against each other in maritime, construction, and culinary projects, earning points based on their performance as a team. For example, the student body as a whole may vote on which crew prepared the best lunch each week or which crew designed the most interesting cardboard sailboat in their maritime lab.

      <p class="mt-8 text-gray-500">
      Finally, our instructional philosophy is greatly impacted by our approach to student evaluation. All students will receive daily professionalism scores and weekly narrative evaluations on formative assessments from each instructor that provide meaningful feedback on each studentâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. 
      <br></br>
      At the conclusion of a term, students receive an updated skills profile detailing continued and/or new areas of strength, which is determined by the entire grade-level team. This system focuses on the relationship between faculty members and students and makes the learning process more personal for both the instructor and the student while at the same time upholding and reinforcing the objectives of each term.
