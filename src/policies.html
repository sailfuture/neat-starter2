SailFuture Academy students are those students needing a kinesthetic learning setting with explicit real-world application and will hail from low-income families eligible for StepUp for Students scholarships, students in foster care, and paying families.

            <p>SailFuture Academy is a private high school with an entrepreneurship focus that prepares students to think critically and effectively solve real-world problems by integrating fundamental business concepts into the Humanities and STEM curriculums in all grades.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-600">We Don’t Just Teach the WHAT; We Teach the WHY</h3>
            <p>Dynamic lesson plans help students learn by synthesizing lesson content, critical thinking, and problem solving in order to demonstrate formative mastery throughout each term. An anchor theme serves as a guide for interdisciplinary integration and informs the objectives and outcomes of a term across subjects. Students learn through the why: why we do it, why we should know it, why it matters.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-600">We Believe That Personalized Feedback = Student Growth</h3>
            <p>All students receive daily professionalism scores and weekly narrative evaluations on formative assessments from each instructor that provide insight to a student’s strengths and weaknesses. At the conclusion of a term, students receive an updated skills profile detailing continued and/or new areas of strength, which is determined by the entire grade-level team.

            <p>Students participate in two 6-hour Learning Labs per week where they are exposed to real-world business challenges in the maritime, construction and culinary fields. Learning labs prepare students to enter their 11th grade year, where they learn business by doing business as paid apprentices in one of our social enterprises. In 12th grade, students take these skills into an external work-study placement with a company in SailFuture’s business council.

            <p>We believe in the power of meaningful relationships built on trust and respect. Each student is matched in a crew of 8 with its own name, identity, and crew leader. The crew plays an integral role in helping each student feel seen, safe and secure in their learning space facilitating a greater willingness to take risks and explore their interests without judgment.

            <p>Students are challenged to apply their knowledge acquired across disciplines to solving real-world problems while at the same time establishing a comprehensive understanding of oneself and how they seek to uniquely market their individual brand.
  
  Each academic area provides the foundation and the framework for students to seamlessly transition from introductory understanding to advanced application through a scaffolded four year curriculum design.
  
  Students demonstrate their achievement formatively as well as summatively through activities such as creating, presenting and defending multi-step, cross-disciplinary projects, proposals, and technical skill assessments.
  
  Students begin their journey at the SailFuture Academy in the ninth grade, a critical year to ensure vital, foundational knowledge is acquired. As students progress through grades 9-12, skills and concepts from the previous year are reinforced and expanded upon.
  
  At the conclusion of a student’s time with SailFuture Academy, we guarantee placement in either a career or in a post-secondary institution. Additionally students leave with a comprehensive digital portfolio that details a curated body of work that represents their knowledge as well as provides a succinct inventory of acquired skills and certifications.

            <p>Adapted from the Code of Ethics of the Education Profession in Florida and Principles of Professional Conduct for the Education Profession in Florida
  
  1. Our school values the worth and dignity of every person, the pursuit of truth, devotion to excellence, acquisition of knowledge, and the nurture of democratic citizenship. Essential to the achievement of these standards are the freedom to learn and to teach and the guarantee of equal opportunity for all.
  2. Our primary concern is the student and the development of the student's potential. Employees will therefore strive for professional growth and will seek to exercise the best professional judgment and integrity.
  3. Concern for the student requires that our instructional personnel:
  a. Shall make reasonable effort to protect the student from conditions harmful to learning and/or to
  the student's mental and/or physical health and/or safety.
  b. Shall not unreasonably restrain a student from independent action in pursuit of learning.
  c. Shall not unreasonably deny a student access to diverse points of view.
  d. Shall not intentionally suppress or distort subject matter relevant to a student's academic program.
  e. Shall not intentionally expose a student to unnecessary embarrassment or disparagement.
  f. Shall not intentionally violate or deny a student's legal rights.
  g. Shall not harass or discriminate against any student on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, marital status, handicapping condition, sexual orientation, or social and family background and shall make reasonable effort to assure that each student is protected from harassment or discrimination.
  h. Shall not exploit a relationship with a student for personal gain or advantage.
  i. Shall keep in confidence personally identifiable information obtained in the course of professional service, unless disclosure serves professional purposes or is required by law.
  4. Aware of the importance of maintaining the respect and confidence of colleagues, of students, of parents, and of the community, employees of our school must display the highest degree of ethical conduct. 
  <br></br>
  This commitment requires that our employees:
  a. Shall maintain honesty in all professional dealings.
  b. Shall not on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national or ethnic origin, political beliefs, marital status, handicapping condition if otherwise qualified, or social and family background deny to a colleague professional benefits or advantages or participation in any professional organization.
  c. Shall not interfere with a colleague's exercise of political or civil rights and responsibilities. 
  D. Shall not engage in harassment or discriminatory conduct which unreasonably interferes with an individual's performance of professional or work responsibilities or with the orderly processes of education or which creates a hostile, intimidating, abusive, offensive, or oppressive environment; and, further, shall make reasonable effort to assure that each individual is protected from such harassment or discrimination.
  e. Shall not make malicious or intentionally false statements about a colleague.
  Training Requirement All instructional personnel and administrators are required as a condition of employment to complete training on these standards of ethical conduct.
