We are excited to announce that SailFuture was selected as one of The Drexel Fund’s Founders Program Fellows. Not only has this provided SailFuture the opportunity to spread our message and our mission, but most significantly it has enabled SailFuture Academy to become a reality.

The Drexel Fund, a nonprofit venture philanthropy fund, was founded in 2015 and serves to support entrepreneurs focused on launching private schools that serve underrepresented and marginalized communities.  
<br><br>
SailFuture Academy will be an all-boys, year-round school designed to immediately bridge the gap between graduation and a career. Students who are currently disengaged from their high school experience will be placed in the driver’s seat to solve real-world problems from the moment they step foot on campus in order to reinspire and reinforce the power of a purposeful education.

Additionally, students will gain industry-specific training in culinary, construction, and maritime skills through hands-on interdisciplinary projects and extended learning labs.
