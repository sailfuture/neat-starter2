Hello world!

        <img class="w-full rounded-lg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbhwzxw0k/image/upload/v1570812746/12139990_831801776932307_5974419264370140447_o.jpg" alt="" width="1310" height="873">

The Drexel Fund, a nonprofit venture philanthropy fund, was founded in 2015 and serves to support entrepreneurs focused on launching private schools that serve underrepresented and marginalized communities.  
<br><br>
SailFuture Academy will be an all-boys, year-round school designed to immediately bridge the gap between graduation and a career. Students who are currently disengaged from their high school experience will be placed in the driverâ€™s seat to solve real-world problems from the moment they step foot on campus in order to reinspire and reinforce the power of a purposeful education.

Additionally, students will gain industry-specific training in culinary, construction, and maritime skills through hands-on interdisciplinary projects and extended learning labs.
